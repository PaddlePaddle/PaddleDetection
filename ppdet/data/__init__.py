# function:
#    module to prepare data for detection model training
#
# implementation notes:
# - Dateset
#    basic interface to accessing data samples in stream mode
#
# - xxxSource (RoiDbSource)
#    * subclass of 'Dataset'
#    * load data from local files and other source data
#
# - xxxOperator (DecodeImage)
#    * subclass of 'BaseOperator'
#    * each op can transform a sample, eg: decode/resize/crop image
#    * each op must obey basic rules defined in transform.operator.base
#
# - transformer
#    * subclass of 'Dataset'
#    * 'MappedDataset' accept a 'xxxSource' and a list of 'xxxOperator'
#       to build a transformed 'Dataset'
