            Removes the oldest samples when the budget is reached.
        max_age (int): maximum number of missed misses before a track is deleted
        n_init (float): Number of frames that a track remains in initialization
            phase. Number of consecutive detections before the track is confirmed. 
            The track state is set to `Deleted` if a miss occurs within the first 
            `n_init` frames.
        metric_type (str): either "euclidean" or "cosine", the distance metric 
            used for measurement to track association.
        matching_threshold (float): samples with larger distance are 
            considered an invalid match.
        max_iou_distance (float): max iou distance threshold
        motion (object): KalmanFilter instance
