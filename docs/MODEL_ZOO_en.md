# Model Libraries and Baselines

## Test Environment

- Python 3.7
- PaddlePaddle Daily version
- CUDA 10.1
- cuDNN 7.5
- NCCL 2.4.8

## General Settings

- All models were trained and tested in the COCO17 dataset.
- Unless special instructions, all the ResNet backbone network using [ResNet-B](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.01187) structure.
- **Inference time (FPS)**: The reasoning time was calculated on a Tesla V100 GPU by `tools/eval.py` testing all validation sets in FPS (number of pictures/second). CuDNN version is 7.5, including data loading, network forward execution and post-processing, and Batch size is 1.

## Training strategy

- We adopt and [Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/blob/master/MODEL_ZOO.md#training-schedules) in the same training strategy.
- 1x strategy indicates that when the total batch size is 8, the initial learning rate is 0.01, and the learning rate decreases by 10 times after 8 epoch and 11 epoch, respectively, and the final training is 12 epoch.
- 2X strategy is twice as much as strategy 1X, and the learning rate adjustment position is twice as much as strategy 1X.

## ImageNet pretraining model
Paddle provides a skeleton network pretraining model based on ImageNet. All pre-training models were trained by standard Imagenet 1K dataset. Res Net and Mobile Net are high-precision pre-training models obtained by cosine learning rate adjustment strategy or SSLD knowledge distillation training. Model details are available at [PaddleClas](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleClas).
