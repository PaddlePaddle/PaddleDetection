# PaddleDetection

PaddleDetection is an end-to-end object detection development kit based on PaddlePaddle, which
aims to help developers in the whole development of training models, optimizing performance and
inference speed, and deploying models. PaddleDetection provides varied object detection architectures
in modular design, and wealthy data augmentation methods, network components, loss functions, etc.
PaddleDetection supported practical projects such as industrial quality inspection, remote sensing
image object detection, and automatic inspection with its practical features such as model compression
and multi-platform deployment.

[PP-YOLO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12099), which is faster and has higer performance than YOLOv4,
has been released, it reached mAP(0.5:0.95) as 45.2%(newest 45.9%) on COCO test2019 dataset and
72.9 FPS on single Test V100. Please refer to [PP-YOLO](configs/ppyolo/README.md) for details.

**Now all models in PaddleDetection require PaddlePaddle version 1.8 or higher, or suitable develop version.**

## Introduction

Features:

- Rich models:

  PaddleDetection provides rich of models, including 100+ pre-trained models
such as object detection, instance segmentation, face detection etc. It covers
the champion models, the practical detection models for cloud and edge device.

- Production Ready:

  Key operations are implemented in C++ and CUDA, together with PaddlePaddle's
highly efficient inference engine, enables easy deployment in server environments.

- Highly Flexible:

  Components are designed to be modular. Model architectures, as well as data
preprocess pipelines, can be easily customized with simple configuration
changes.

- Performance Optimized:

  With the help of the underlying PaddlePaddle framework, faster training and
reduced GPU memory footprint is achieved. Notably, YOLOv3 training is
much faster compared to other frameworks. Another example is Mask-RCNN
(ResNet50), we managed to fit up to 4 images per GPU (Tesla V100 16GB) during
multi-GPU training.
